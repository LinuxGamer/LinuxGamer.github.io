Hey folks, I decided that I wanted to focus more on blog posts and stuff like that on my site, so I am in the process of migrating my site to a really cool Jekyll theme called [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). The migration will take time and the site may go down at many times throughout the time, and at the end I'll put another post up saying that the migration is complete. But before I go, I'd like to explain my reasons behind the migration and a little bit about the Static Site Generator I've chosen to use.

## Reasons For Migration
I recently got a new and improved website setup on [Codeberg](https://linuxgamer.codeberg.page/) which is similar to this, but all manual. It took so long to update new posts as and update things, I decided that I wanted to streamline things and so I came to GitHub and added all the cool features available here, such as: Jekyll and numerous comments systems such as Utterances and Giscus (which I tried but couldn't get its working).
